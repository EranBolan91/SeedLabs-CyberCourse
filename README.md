# Cyber Course README

This repository contains the materials and labs for the Cyber course I completed at the **HIT College**. The course covered various topics related to cyber security and practical hands-on experience. The following sections provide an overview of each lab and its focus.

## ARP Cache Poisoning Attack Lab
This lab focused on understanding and simulating ARP cache poisoning attacks. It involved learning about Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and its vulnerabilities. Through this lab, we gained hands-on experience in manipulating ARP tables, intercepting network traffic, and performing Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks.

## IP and ICMP Attacks Lab
In this lab, we explored various IP and ICMP attacks commonly used by malicious actors. We learned about IP packet fragmentation, ICMP redirect attacks, and ICMP flooding. Through practical exercises, we gained insights into the vulnerabilities associated with these protocols and their impact on network security.

## Local DNS Attack Lab
The Local DNS Attack Lab aimed to enhance our understanding of Domain Name System (DNS) vulnerabilities. We explored techniques such as DNS cache poisoning, DNS spoofing, and DNS amplification attacks. By conducting these hands-on exercises, we learned how to manipulate DNS records and exploit weaknesses in DNS infrastructure.

## Remote DNS Attack Lab
The Remote DNS Attack Lab built upon the knowledge gained in the Local DNS Attack Lab. It focused on remote DNS attacks, including DNS tunneling and DNS rebinding. Through practical scenarios, we gained practical experience in exploiting remote DNS vulnerabilities and understanding their potential impact on network security.

## RSA Encryption and Signature Lab
This lab centered around RSA encryption and digital signatures. We learned about the mathematical principles behind the RSA algorithm and its applications in secure communication and data integrity. Through practical exercises, we implemented RSA encryption and digital signature schemes to understand their strengths and limitations.

## Secret-Key Encryption
The Secret-Key Encryption lab delved into symmetric encryption algorithms and their practical implementation. We explored various symmetric key encryption techniques such as DES, AES and etc. Through hands-on exercises, we gained experience in encrypting and decrypting data using secret-key algorithms and understanding their role in ensuring confidentiality.

Each lab folder within this repository contains the necessary resources, documentation, and instructions to conduct the respective lab exercises. It is recommended to follow the provided guidelines and experiment in a controlled environment to ensure the safety and legality of your actions.

Please note that the labs conducted during this course are for educational purposes only and should not be used for malicious activities or unauthorized access. Always adhere to ethical guidelines and obtain proper authorization before performing any security assessments.

Feel free to explore the lab folders and engage in practical learning to enhance your understanding of cyber security concepts and techniques.
